title: "Critcal CSS energy analysis"
output: html_notebook

The file structure is as follows: *TODO*

```{r}
# Get the aggregated measures (cpu load, memory usage, energy consumption and load time) for the specific browser (equal to folder name).
get_energy <- function(browser_name) {
  subjects <- list.dirs(path = paste("./data", browser_name, "data/nexus6p", sep="/"), full.names = TRUE)[-1]
  data <- data.frame(
    name = character(),
    critical = logical(),
    energy_consumption = double(),
    time = integer(),
    memory_usage = integer(),
    cpu_usage = double(),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
  data

  for (subject in subjects) {
    for (battery_run in list.files(path = paste(subject, browser_name, "android", sep="/"), full.names = TRUE)[-1]) {
      print(battery_run)
    }
  }
}
get_energy("chrome")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
