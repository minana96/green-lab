"""After launch script

This script will be executed after the target web app is launched 
but before profiling starts.

Chrome browser displays pop-up windows for customization when the
app data is cleared. This would prevent a web app from launching.
The purpose of this script is to interact programmatically with
Chrome so that all pop-ups would be closed before profiling starts.
The interaction is customized for Nexus6P mobile device and Chrome
version V85.0.4183.127.
